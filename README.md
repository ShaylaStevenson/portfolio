## Introduction
This is a responsive portfolio designed to introduce myself while utilizing bootstrap tools. You will find that I have heavily customized the Bootstrap 4 grid system by use of utility classes and CSS. The application should convey my personal aesthetics to the user through color, images, and other styling techniques. I hope you enjoy using the site as much I did making it!

## Responsive Design
Use the application on your cellphone or desktop with ease.
* Collapsible navigation bar
* Images and text resizes and aligns
* Body covers full width of mobile device

## Grid System
Bootstrap's grid system was used as the framework for the application.
* Find use of containers, rows, columns, and sub-columns
* Customization applied directly to grid through utilities in the HTML documents.
